# eslintrc



* Following command will add this repo as submodule: 

  `git submodule add https://github.com/gt3/eslintrc config/eslintrc`

* To incldue submodules during clone use:

  `git clone --recursive <project url>`
  
* To update outdated submodules use:

  `git submodule update`


Note: Eslint rules used in _.eslintrc_ may seem too forgiving. Perhaps another _.eslintrc-strict_ file?
